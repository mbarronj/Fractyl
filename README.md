# Fractyl
FreeCAD variant of the popular Dactyl-Manuform keyboard generator software. 
Written in Python, native FreeCAD geometry generation. 
Uses measurements and descriptions of hand dimensions to generate optimal geometry. 

Also contains code for observing hand movements with a webcam and use Mediapipe
to track hand motion for metrology (WIP)

This is still in early development phase. Does not currently generate a full keyboard.
This is an active work-in-progress, and I am not a professional software developer.
So, feedback is welcome. Pull requests are welcome. Suggestions, comments, and bug reports are welcome.
Just keep in mind that I may take longer than usual to respond, and will likely make some errors.

If you use, please let me know how it goes.
