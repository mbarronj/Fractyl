# Fractyl
FreeCAD variant of the popular Dactyl-Manuform keyboard generator software. 
Written in Python, native FreeCAD geometry generation. 
Uses measurements and descriptions of hand dimensions to generate optimal geometry. 

Also contains code for observing hand movements with a webcam and use Mediapipe
to track hand motion for metrology (WIP)

This is still in early development phase. Does not currently generate a full keyboard.
This is an active work-in-progress, and I am not a professional software developer.
So, feedback is welcome. Pull requests are welcome. Suggestions, comments, and bug reports are welcome.
Just keep in mind that I may take longer than usual to respond, and will likely make some errors.

If you use, please let me know how it goes.

Everything needs to reside in the FreeCAD Macro's folder for any of these scripts to function.
On my Windows machine, this is "Users/username/AppData/Roaming/FreeCAD/Macros".
